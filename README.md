# CDIPS_2015

### Summer group research project with mentor Adam Kalman from Kanjoya.

This project is the result of my participation in UC Berkeley's Career Development Initiative for the Physical Sciences (CDIPS) [grad student-organized summer data science workshop.](http://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/2015-cdips-data-science-workshop/)

The annual 3 week workshop pairs tech mentors with a small groups of students to work on real industry data science projects. It's a great opportunity for PhDs transitioning into tech to learn the tools of the trade, visit work spaces, and connect with experts. 

### Our Group
* Leader: Adam Kalman, Lead Data Scientist at Kanjoya
* Team: Jade Zhang, Kevin Pollock, Dharshi Devendran, and Shannon Hateley

### Our dataset
Every post from Jan-July 2015 (534,305 entries) from the **experience project**,
a social network where users annonymously share life experiences and personal stories.

**By asking:**

*"Which users post to which groups?"*

**We can learn:**
  * if bots / trolls are posting / ruining groups
  * if posting patterns indicate attrition problems
  * if a user can be recommended new groups

### Skills
* Handling and cleaning large datasets
* Natural Language Processing
* Supervised and unsupervised learning
* **Python** (ipython notebook, scipy, pandas, numpy)
* **R**
* Shiny
* data visualization
